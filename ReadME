# DQ'INSIGHT: Data Quality Assessment Tool

This project is a Streamlit application for performing data quality assessments on datasets. The tool allows users to upload a CSV file and provides an overview of missing data, duplicates, and other data quality issues.

## Features of App

- **app.py**: Main application file.
- **data/**: Directory for storing sample datasets.
- **utils/**: Directory containing utility functions for data loading, quality checks, and visualisation.
- **assets/**: Directory for static files like images or custom styles.

This app allows you to:

- **Upload and Summarise PDF Files**:

Extract and view text from PDF files.
Generate a summary of the text.
As an example PDF file, we have the Making-Laws.pdf file to experiment with.

- **Perform Data Quality(DQ) Checks of CSV Files**:

Missing Data: Identifies null or missing values.
Outliers: Detects data points that deviate significantly.
Inconsistencies: Flags mismatched data patterns.
Duplications: Identifies duplicate records.
Invalid Values: Detects out-of-range values.
Data Type Errors: Identifies type mismatches.

- **Perform Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) of CSV Files**:

Upload a CSV file and view its contents(200MB limit)
See a default line chart of all columns.
Customise your chart by selecting columns for X and Y axes.
Save your customised charts.
As an example CSV file, we have the daily-bike-share.csv file to experiment with.

- **Machine Learning Functionality**:

Apply machine learning with guidance on typical steps and deployment options.

- **Results and Reccomendations**:

After running the analysis and ML models, you will see results here, along with recommendations for next steps and deployment options.
